# FamContact: Family contacts simplified

## About my project

**What will the application do?**

- The "FamContact" software is designed to serve as a 
comprehensive family contact and event management system.
Users will have the ability to effortlessly add 
individuals to their database, complete with specifying 
their familial relation, and inputting essential 
details such as birthdays, emails, phone numbers, etc.
Users even have the ability to define and create custom
events like graduation dates or significant milestones. 
The software empowers users to efficiently search for 
upcoming birthdays, filter contacts by email providers 
(e.g., Gmail, Yahoo), and conduct queries to retrieve 
specific information. Moreover, users can seamlessly 
update contact details, establish new familial 
relationships, and introduce new individuals into the 
system. Last but not the least, the user is also given
the option to update information and delete content from 
the database as desired. This ensures that family data 
remains consistently up-to-date and readily accessible for 
future interactions. A read-only mode and a password
requirement may also be added to ensure that such 
sensitive data is not viewed by an unauthorised 
individual or altered incorrectly.
- An important aspect to be noticed in this project is the
  CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) format used in the
  blueprint design of this system.

**Who will use it?**

- The "FamilyConnect" project is tailored to meet the 
needs of a diverse user base. It targets individuals 
who hold family connections in high regard and are in 
search of a practical solution to manage family events 
and contacts. This encompasses individuals with joint 
family structures, those who encounter challenges in 
keeping track of various family events, and those who 
may not feel entirely at ease with currently available 
apps for this purpose, such as senior citizens. 
"FamilyConnect" aspires to serve as a widely accessible
inclusive and user-friendly tool for anyone seeking to 
maintain and strengthen their family ties through efficient 
information management.

**Why is this project of interest to me?**

- The "FamilyConnect" project holds profound personal 
significance for me, as it embodies the cultural values
and dynamics of my upbringing. I originate from a 
background where close-knit, extended family structures 
are the norm. The art of staying connected and staying 
informed about each other's lives is ingrained in our 
cultural fabric. In the rapidly evolving landscape of 
data and information, the need for effective 
information management and tracking has become 
increasingly paramount. On a personal level, I 
recognize that such a system would significantly 
enhance the convenience and quality of my own life. 
My passion for this project extends beyond a mere 
academic endeavor; it's a heartfelt commitment to 
create a tool that not only caters to my own needs but 
also serves as a valuable resource for a diverse range 
of users facing similar familial circumstances. 
"FamilyConnect" represents my aspiration to bring 
families closer together, bridging the gap between 
traditional values and modern lifestyles in today's 
fast-paced world.
